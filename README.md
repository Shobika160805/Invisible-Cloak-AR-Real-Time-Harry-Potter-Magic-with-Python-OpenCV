# Invisible-Cloak-AR-Real-Time-Harry-Potter-Magic-with-Python-OpenCV
A real-time computer vision project in Python that turns a colored (light blue) cloak invisible using OpenCV and NumPy. The application detects the cloak in a webcam feed and seamlessly replaces it with the captured background, recreating the iconic “Harry Potter” invisibility effect.
